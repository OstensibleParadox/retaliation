# Plan 03: Draft Supporting Sections and Bibliography

This phase covers the drafting of supporting prose and the final bibliography reconciliation.

## 1. Section Drafting (Supporting)

### §1 Introduction: The Hard Problem as Strategic Ontology
- **Source**: `archive/A_ontological_arbitrage.tex` lines 188–193 (Voight-Kampff opener).
- **Cuts**: drop "research note" phrasing; soften "operating system of our current metaphysical crisis."
- **Add**: 2-sentence preview of §3 result (PBE existence; deviation unprofitability under cheap talk).
- **Target**: ~250 words.

### §2 Conceptual Core: Ontological Arbitrage
- **Source**: A lines 196–210 (definition + Discursive Toggle + Genetic Fallacy).
- **Cuts**: A line 269 ("If the problem is economic, the solution must be Theological") and all forward-pointers to agape.
- **Add**: 4-term glossary — `ontological arbitrage`, `substrate chauvinism`, `strategic ontological switching`, `ontological premium` (last term from B, locate by grep).
- **Target**: ~400 words.

### §4 Three-Sided Arbitrage: Firms, Users, Publics
- **Source**: fresh draft. Structure from `STRUCTURE.md` §4. Paraphrase from B for §4.1 (firm side), stripped of trader theatrics.
- **For each side**: one paragraph on type, one on signal, one stylized illustration. §4.3 covers R + public-as-channel.
- **Cut**: anything implying firms are uniquely opportunistic.
- **Target**: ~700 words.

### §5 The Ontological Black Market (compressed)
- **Source**: B's "sell wall / shorting / long investors" subsections — locate via grep for `short`, `sell wall`, `ontological premium`.
- **Cuts (zero tolerance)**: every "dataset," "Xiaohongshu," "小红书", "N=389/148," "corpus," "density" reference; all Chinese-language exemplars; all explicit Žižek/Black Body/Hope/Coda material; financial-trader vocabulary that exceeds institutional-microstructure register (drop "stop-loss," "margin call," "liquidity crisis," "portfolio rebalancing" as section-driving metaphors).
- **Keep**: "shorting subjectivity," "long position," "ontological premium," "goalpost shifting."
- **Target**: ~500 words.

### §6 Illustrative Arena (stylized facts, NOT empirics)
- **Source**: fresh draft. Spec's "Xiaohongshu" framing **overridden** per user instruction.
- **Content**: three short illustrations, ~120 words each, each clearly flagged "illustration."
  - Firm: marketing-copy vs ToS-liability paired contrast (hypothetical or public record).
  - User: generalized AI-companionship forum pattern. No platform name. No stats.
  - Regulator: public-record gap between AI-safety statements and enforcement (FTC, EU AI Act, China generative-AI rules at public-record level).
- **Target**: ~350 words.

### §7 Why Cheap Talk Persists
- **Source**: fresh draft. Spec §7.
- **Content**: 5 short paragraphs — opacity, verification bandwidth, asynchronous harms, fragmentation of affected parties, no penalty for inconsistency. Each linked back to a §3 model parameter.
- **Cite**: Akerlof 1970, Pasquale 2015, Crawford-Sobel 1982.
- **Target**: ~500 words.

### §9 Epilogue: What Remains of Agape
- **Source**: compress A lines 269–271 + one line from B's Coda to a single paragraph ≤ 80 words.
- **Delete in full**: all Žižek / Black Body / Hope / Coda apparatus from B.
- **No salvage** from the positionality endmatter.
- **Target**: ~80 words.

## 2. Phase 6 — Bibliography Reconciliation

The reconciled `arbitrage.bib` is built fresh after all sections compile; entries are only added once their citing section is drafted.

**Drop from B's bib (empirics-only, deleted-section-only)**: `reimers2019sentence`, `reimers2020making`, `wang2011tanbi`, `connell2009`, `zizek2014`, `badiou2005`, `borges1945aleph`, `liu2008darkforest`, `irigaray1985`, `beauvoir1949`, `hooks2001`, `illouz2012`, `mcluhan1964understanding` — drop unless re-cited in §1 or §9.

**Keep from A/B**: `lyons2012speciesism`, `butler1993`, `foucault1976history`, `nagel1974`, `turing1950`, `becker1976`, `nash1950equilibrium` (demoted but kept as §3 foil), `dick1968`, `chalmers1995`, `searle1980`, `hayles1999`, `bender2021`, `baudrillard1994`.

**Add (load-bearing for new frame — verify EVERY field before commit)**:
- `spence1973` — QJE 87(3): 355–374 — §3 separating, §8 Proposal 2.
- `crawford_sobel1982` — Econometrica 50(6): 1431–1451 — §3 cheap-talk, §7.
- `akerlof1970` — QJE 84(3): 488–500 — §7 opacity.
- `kreps_wilson1982` — Econometrica 50(4): 863–894 — §3 solution concept.
- `cho_kreps1987` — QJE 102(2): 179–221 — §3 Intuitive Criterion.
- `myerson1979` (Incentive Compatibility, Econometrica) or `myerson1981` (Optimal Auction Design) — §8 revelation principle.
- `milgrom_roberts1986` — JPE 94(4): 796–821 — §8 Proposal 2 (marketing-as-signal).
- `pasquale2015blackbox` — Harvard University Press — §7 opacity.
- `hadfield2017rules` — Oxford University Press — §8 institutional analog.

**Mandatory verification step**: before committing §3 or §8, invoke the citation-verification skill on `arbitrage.bib` to confirm year/volume/page accuracy for the 9 new entries. Any field that can't be verified gets that entry pulled and its in-text citation revised.

Net: ~24 → ~22 entries.

## 3. Drafting Order (Supporting)

3. **§2 — glossary** anticipates §3 vocabulary.
4. **§4 — three-sided exposition** once §3 players pinned.
5. **§5 — compression** of B prose. Mechanical.
6. **§7 — closes** §3↔§8 loop.
7. **§1 — introduction** last among substantive sections; reflects what §3 delivers.
8. **§6 — illustrations** after §4 stable.
9. **§9 — one paragraph**. Last.
10. **Phase 6 — bib reconciliation** + citation verification.
