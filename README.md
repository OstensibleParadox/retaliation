# Plan: Clean-Rebuild as AIES 26 Submission in `OstensibleParadox/aies26`

## Context

The arbitrage paper exists today in two stale layers — a ~278-line philosophical seed (`A`) and a ~980-line empirics-heavy expansion (`B`) — neither suitable for AIES 26. User is consolidating into one paper, retitled **"Ontological Arbitrage: Bayesian Equilibrium under Substrate Chauvinism"**, with a frozen thesis: substrate chauvinism (input) → Bayesian signaling game (formalism) → mechanism design (output).

A clean new repo `https://github.com/OstensibleParadox/aies26` has been created for this rebuild. Implementation runs there, not in the current planning workspace (`OstensibleParadox/credentials` clone at `/home/user/repo/`). The user will commit the source inputs (A, B, AAAI template, structure spec) to that new repo before implementation begins; the implementing agent finds them at the paths defined in §1 below.

Locked decisions (do not relitigate):
- Title + one-sentence thesis frozen (see `_inputs/structure.md`).
- Drop ALL empirics: no NPS-4, no Xiaohongshu, no Narcissus Mechanism, no Black Body Relation, no ablations, no Chinese-language exemplars.
- Genre: formal political economy / mechanism design.
- §3 players: **three** — Firm (F), User (U), Regulator (R). Publics/intellectuals fold into R as a noisy signal channel.
- Venue: AIES 26 via AAAI 2026 `\documentclass[letterpaper]{article}` + `\usepackage[submission]{aaai2026}`. pdflatex + natbib + bibtex.
- Archive A and B in `archive/`; commit to git.
- Drop positionality endmatter entirely.
- Levinas / agape: at most one ironic sentence in §9.

Intended outcome: a clean AAAI-2026-formatted LaTeX project (~7 body pages, ~4500–5500 body words) that compiles via pdflatex, with the 9-section structure below, archived originals, and full git history.

Section drafting is sequenced so the formal spine (§3) and its operative conclusion (§8) are pinned before downstream prose, which depends on them.

## 1. Expected input layout (user commits before implementation)

```
aies26/  (repo root)
├── _inputs/
│   ├── A_ontological_arbitrage.tex        # ~278 lines, philosophical seed

```

If any of these are missing when the implementation agent starts, it must STOP and surface the gap rather than improvising replacements.

Modular sections so §3/§8 revisions show as isolated diffs.

## 3. Phase 0 — Scaffold (single commit)

Operations (all paths relative to repo root):
1. `mkdir -p sections archive`
2. `mv _inputs/A_ontological_arbitrage.tex archive/`
3. `mv _inputs/A_ontological_arbitrage.bib archive/`
4. `mv _inputs/B_aies26_arbitrage.tex archive/`
5. `mv _inputs/B_aies26_arbitrage.bib archive/`
6. `mv _inputs/B_aies26_endmatter.tex archive/`
7. `mv _inputs/structure.md STRUCTURE.md`
8. `cp _inputs/template_aaai26/AnonymousSubmission/LaTeX/aaai2026.sty .`
9. `cp _inputs/template_aaai26/AnonymousSubmission/LaTeX/aaai2026.bst .`
10. `rm -rf _inputs/`
11. Create `sections/00_frontmatter.tex` … `sections/09_epilogue.tex` as stubs (each: section header + `% TODO`).
12. Create `arbitrage.tex` with AAAI 2026 preamble (§5 of this plan) and `\input{sections/*}`.
13. Create empty `arbitrage.bib` (entries land in Phase 6).
14. Create `README.md` (one paragraph: title, status, build command).
15. Extend `.gitignore` (§6).
16. Initial scaffold commit.

After this commit, run `pdflatex arbitrage` once to confirm the stub document compiles before any prose is added.

## 4. Section drafting

For each section: anchor in `STRUCTURE.md` for the spec, then consult `archive/B_aies26_arbitrage.tex` (line numbers below are approximate — the implementing agent verifies them against the committed file). One git commit per section.

### §1 Introduction: The Hard Problem as Strategic Ontology
- **Source**: `archive/A_ontological_arbitrage.tex` lines 188–193 (Voight-Kampff opener).
- **Cuts**: drop "research note" phrasing; soften "operating system of our current metaphysical crisis."
- **Add**: 2-sentence preview of §3 result (PBE existence; deviation unprofitability under cheap talk).
- **Target**: ~250 words.

### §2 Conceptual Core: Ontological Arbitrage
- **Source**: A lines 196–210 (definition + Discursive Toggle + Genetic Fallacy).
- **Cuts**: A line 269 ("If the problem is economic, the solution must be Theological") and all forward-pointers to agape.
- **Add**: 4-term glossary — `ontological arbitrage`, `substrate chauvinism`, `strategic ontological switching`, `ontological premium` (last term from B, locate by grep).
- **Target**: ~400 words.

### §3 From Static Nash to Bayesian Signaling Equilibrium — **LOAD-BEARING**
- **Foil only**: B's 2×2 Nash payoff matrix becomes Table 1, labelled "the inadequate dyadic model." Locate via grep for `Objectify`/`Recognize` in `archive/B_aies26_arbitrage.tex`.
- **Discard**: B's static Nash proof (the `Eth > 2·Sec` inequality is not the load-bearing claim).
- **Draft fresh** (this IS the contribution):
  - **Players**: F (firm), U (user), R (regulator). Publics + intellectuals fold into R as a noisy signal channel modifying R's prior.
  - **Type space**: θ_F ∈ {high-gov, low-gov}, θ_U ∈ {high-vuln, low-vuln}, θ_R ∈ {high-bw, low-bw}; system opacity θ_S as F's private parameter. Common prior π on Θ.
  - **Signal space**: m_F ∈ {marketing-anthropomorphic, policy-deflationary}; m_U ∈ {invest, detach}; m_R ∈ {inspect, sanction, abstain}. Exogenous public signal z ∈ Z feeds R's posterior.
  - **Information structure**: sequential — F → U → R. Types private; messages public.
  - **Solution concept**: Perfect Bayesian Equilibrium (PBE) as headline. Sequential Equilibrium (Kreps-Wilson 1982) as consistency strengthening. Intuitive Criterion (Cho-Kreps 1987) as refinement.
  - **Worked example (mandatory, ~1 page)**: Under c(m_F) = 0 (cheap talk), show pooling equilibrium — both governance types pool on anthropomorphic marketing; both vulnerability types pool on invest; R abstains. Compute posteriors = priors. No profitable unilateral deviation. Then redesign c(m_F) via audit-trail cost; derive single-crossing threshold (Spence 1973) above which separating PBE exists.
  - **Proposition (named, with proof sketch)**: "Under cheap-talk cost structure, pooling-on-anthropomorphize is a PBE surviving the Intuitive Criterion. Under audit-trail signal cost satisfying single-crossing in θ_F, a separating PBE exists in which m_F reveals θ_F."
- **Figures**: Table 1 (the discarded 2×2 Nash, as foil) + Figure 1 (extensive-form game tree via tikz).
- **Target**: ~1500 words (~2.5 pages with display math).

### §4 Three-Sided Arbitrage: Firms, Users, Publics
- **Source**: fresh draft. Structure from `STRUCTURE.md` §4. Paraphrase from B for §4.1 (firm side), stripped of trader theatrics.
- **For each side**: one paragraph on type, one on signal, one stylized illustration. §4.3 covers R + public-as-channel.
- **Cut**: anything implying firms are uniquely opportunistic.
- **Target**: ~700 words.

### §5 The Ontological Black Market (compressed)
- **Source**: B's "sell wall / shorting / long investors" subsections — locate via grep for `short`, `sell wall`, `ontological premium`.
- **Cuts (zero tolerance)**: every "dataset," "Xiaohongshu," "小红书", "N=389/148," "corpus," "density" reference; all Chinese-language exemplars; all explicit Žižek/Black Body/Hope/Coda material; financial-trader vocabulary that exceeds institutional-microstructure register (drop "stop-loss," "margin call," "liquidity crisis," "portfolio rebalancing" as section-driving metaphors).
- **Keep**: "shorting subjectivity," "long position," "ontological premium," "goalpost shifting."
- **Target**: ~500 words.

### §6 Illustrative Arena (stylized facts, NOT empirics)
- **Source**: fresh draft. Spec's "Xiaohongshu" framing **overridden** per user instruction.
- **Content**: three short illustrations, ~120 words each, each clearly flagged "illustration."
  - Firm: marketing-copy vs ToS-liability paired contrast (hypothetical or public record).
  - User: generalized AI-companionship forum pattern. No platform name. No stats.
  - Regulator: public-record gap between AI-safety statements and enforcement (FTC, EU AI Act, China generative-AI rules at public-record level).
- **Target**: ~350 words.

### §7 Why Cheap Talk Persists
- **Source**: fresh draft. Spec §7.
- **Content**: 5 short paragraphs — opacity, verification bandwidth, asynchronous harms, fragmentation of affected parties, no penalty for inconsistency. Each linked back to a §3 model parameter.
- **Cite**: Akerlof 1970, Pasquale 2015, Crawford-Sobel 1982.
- **Target**: ~500 words.

### §8 Mechanism Design: Equilibrium Redesign — **LOAD-BEARING**
- **Source**: fresh draft. Operative conclusion per `STRUCTURE.md`.
- **Three proposals**, each with: (a) §3 signal-cost parameter modified, (b) equilibrium shift induced (pooling → separating or off-path belief constraint), (c) existing-law analog establishing feasibility.
  - **Proposal 1 — Sanctionable inconsistency**: jointly auditable marketing + liability docs; inconsistent ontological claims trigger deceptive-practices penalty. Analog: FTC §5; SEC anti-fraud rules.
  - **Proposal 2 — Costly signaling (Spence)**: mandatory third-party capability audits as precondition for agency/safety marketing. Analog: pharmaceutical efficacy trials; food labeling. Threshold from §3 single-crossing.
  - **Proposal 3 — Auditable records**: append-only, regulator-readable logs of model behavior tied to capability claims. Analog: GDPR Art. 30; SOX §404; EU AI Act Art. 12.
- **Cite**: Spence 1973, Myerson 1979/1981, Milgrom-Roberts 1986, Hadfield 2017.
- **Target**: ~1000 words.

### §9 Epilogue: What Remains of Agape
- **Source**: compress A lines 269–271 + one line from B's Coda to a single paragraph ≤ 80 words.
- **Delete in full**: all Žižek / Black Body / Hope / Coda apparatus from B.
- **No salvage** from the positionality endmatter.
- **Target**: ~80 words.

## 5. AAAI 2026 build configuration

Preamble for `arbitrage.tex`:
- `\documentclass[letterpaper]{article}`
- `\usepackage[submission]{aaai2026}` (anonymous-submission mode)
- Required by the template: `times`, `helvet`, `courier`, `url[hyphens]`, `graphicx`, `natbib`, `caption`, `algorithm`, `algorithmic`.
- Add: `amsmath`, `amsthm`, `amssymb`, `mathtools`, `booktabs`, `tikz` (for §3 Figure 1 game tree), `hyperref` (after `natbib`).
- **Forbidden by the template** (must not appear anywhere): `authblk`, `balance`, `CJK`, `float`, `flushend`, `fontenc`, `fullpage`, `geometry`, `titlesec`, `titling`, `biblatex`, `fontspec`, `unicode-math`, `setspace`, `microtype`, `subcaption`, `luatexja-fontspec`.

Build command (must be re-runnable from clean):
```bash
pdflatex arbitrage && bibtex arbitrage && pdflatex arbitrage && pdflatex arbitrage
```

Page target: **7 body pages + unlimited references** (AAAI 2026 / AIES 26 limit). Word target in body: 4500–5500 (verify via `texcount -inc arbitrage.tex`).

## 6. `.gitignore` extension

Append to whatever `.gitignore` exists:

```
# LaTeX build artifacts
*.aux
*.log
*.synctex.gz
*.bbl
*.blg
*.toc
*.out
*.run.xml
*.fdb_latexmk
*.fls
*.nav
*.snm
*.vrb
*.lof
*.lot
# macOS
.DS_Store
```

`*.pdf` NOT gitignored — AAAI submission requires PDF; the final compiled PDF gets committed once at the end. If draft PDFs cause review noise, gitignore later with `!arbitrage.pdf` override.

## 7. Bibliography reconciliation (Phase 6)

The reconciled `arbitrage.bib` is built fresh after all sections compile; entries are only added once their citing section is drafted.

**Drop from B's bib (empirics-only, deleted-section-only)**: `reimers2019sentence`, `reimers2020making`, `wang2011tanbi`, `connell2009`, `zizek2014`, `badiou2005`, `borges1945aleph`, `liu2008darkforest`, `irigaray1985`, `beauvoir1949`, `hooks2001`, `illouz2012`, `mcluhan1964understanding` — drop unless re-cited in §1 or §9.

**Keep from A/B**: `lyons2012speciesism`, `butler1993`, `foucault1976history`, `nagel1974`, `turing1950`, `becker1976`, `nash1950equilibrium` (demoted but kept as §3 foil), `dick1968`, `chalmers1995`, `searle1980`, `hayles1999`, `bender2021`, `baudrillard1994`.

**Add (load-bearing for new frame — verify EVERY field before commit)**:
- `spence1973` — QJE 87(3): 355–374 — §3 separating, §8 Proposal 2.
- `crawford_sobel1982` — Econometrica 50(6): 1431–1451 — §3 cheap-talk, §7.
- `akerlof1970` — QJE 84(3): 488–500 — §7 opacity.
- `kreps_wilson1982` — Econometrica 50(4): 863–894 — §3 solution concept.
- `cho_kreps1987` — QJE 102(2): 179–221 — §3 Intuitive Criterion.
- `myerson1979` (Incentive Compatibility, Econometrica) or `myerson1981` (Optimal Auction Design) — §8 revelation principle.
- `milgrom_roberts1986` — JPE 94(4): 796–821 — §8 Proposal 2 (marketing-as-signal).
- `pasquale2015blackbox` — Harvard University Press — §7 opacity.
- `hadfield2017rules` — Oxford University Press — §8 institutional analog.

**Mandatory verification step**: before committing §3 or §8, invoke the citation-verification skill on `arbitrage.bib` to confirm year/volume/page accuracy for the 9 new entries. Any field that can't be verified gets that entry pulled and its in-text citation revised.

Net: ~24 → ~22 entries.

## 8. Drafting order (commit-per-section)

1. §3 — formal spine. Pin player set, type space, solution concept, worked example first. Biggest replan risk.
2. §8 — proposals depend on §3 parameters.
3. §2 — glossary anticipates §3 vocabulary.
4. §4 — three-sided exposition once §3 players pinned.
5. §5 — compression of B prose. Mechanical.
6. §7 — closes §3↔§8 loop.
7. §1 — introduction last among substantive sections; reflects what §3 delivers.
8. §6 — illustrations after §4 stable.
9. §9 — one paragraph. Last.
10. Phase 6 — bib reconciliation + citation verification.

## 9. Critical files to create / modify

- **Create**: `arbitrage.tex`, `arbitrage.bib`, `README.md`, `STRUCTURE.md` (moved), `sections/00_frontmatter.tex` … `sections/09_epilogue.tex`.
- **Move**: 5 input files into `archive/`; `_inputs/structure.md` → `STRUCTURE.md`.
- **Copy out**: `aaai2026.sty`, `aaai2026.bst` from `_inputs/template_aaai26/AnonymousSubmission/LaTeX/`.
- **Delete**: entire `_inputs/` tree after extraction.
- **Extend**: `.gitignore`.

## 10. Acceptance criteria (all must hold before opening PR)

1. `pdflatex arbitrage && bibtex arbitrage && pdflatex arbitrage && pdflatex arbitrage` compiles cleanly, no missing-citation warnings.
2. `grep -ri -E '(Xiaohongshu|小红书|NPS-4|Narcissus Mechanism|Black Body Relation|ablation|corpus|density|Žižek|养AI|DeepL)' sections/ arbitrage.tex` returns zero hits.
3. `grep -E '(luatexja|setmainjfont|setsansjfont|CJK|fontspec|biblatex|unicode-math)' arbitrage.tex sections/*.tex` returns zero hits.
4. §3 contains an explicit PBE statement, at least one named proposition with proof sketch (pooling under cheap talk + separating under audit cost), and Figure 1 (extensive-form game tree).
5. §8 contains three concrete mechanism-design proposals, each with an existing-law analog.
6. §9 ≤ 80 words.
7. Body word count 4500–5500 (verify via `texcount -inc arbitrage.tex`); body page count ≤ 7.
8. Bibliography contains all 9 load-bearing additions; each cited at least once; citation-verification skill reports clean.
9. `archive/` committed; A and B files intact, unmodified, byte-identical to the user's `_inputs/` versions.
10. `git log --oneline` shows scaffold commit + per-section commits + bib commit (≥ 11 commits).
11. PR opened on `OstensibleParadox/aies26` with the compiled PDF attached or committed.

## 11. Risks

- **R1 (highest): §3 written too informally → AAAI/AIES game-theory referees reject.** Mitigation: commit early to PBE + Intuitive Criterion; worked example with explicit posteriors is non-negotiable; Figure 1 extensive-form game tree included.
- **R2 (high): AIES 26 venue + zero empirics = genre mismatch.** AIES reviewers expect empirical or systems contributions. Mitigation: position §6 stylized facts as "motivating illustrations from public record"; lean §8 mechanism proposals into AIES's governance-friendly register. Fallback if desk-rejected on empirics-light grounds: SSRN + re-target JLA or JEP.
- **R3: Three-sided claim under-evidenced without empirics.** Mitigation: §6 illustrations clearly flagged; §4 stylized facts tight to §3 model.
- **R4: Mechanism design dismissed as utopian.** Mitigation: every §8 proposal has a current-law analog. If none can be found for a proposal, drop the proposal.
- **R5: Substrate chauvinism premise over-claims (AI + trans + non-normative + non-human animals).** Mitigation: scope §3 model explicitly to the AI case; let §§1–2 keep broader frame as motivation; one footnote noting analogous spaces for other domains.
- **R6: 7-page limit forces cuts to §3 or §8.** Mitigation: §3 ≥ 2 pages and §8 ≥ 1.5 pages are protected floors. Tighten §§1, 5, 6, 7 on overrun.
- **R7: Load-bearing citations misremembered (Spence year, Crawford-Sobel page range, etc.).** Mitigation: citation-verification skill runs before §3 or §8 commits.
- **R8: AAAI 2026 template version drift.** The `_inputs/template_aaai26/` snapshot is frozen. Before the final compile, the agent checks `https://aaai.org/conference/aaai/aaai-26/` for any pre-submission template update; if updated, the user is asked whether to swap the `.sty`/`.bst`.

## 12. Verification (end-to-end)

Run from the rebuilt repo root:

1. `pdflatex arbitrage && bibtex arbitrage && pdflatex arbitrage && pdflatex arbitrage` → PDF generated, no errors.
2. `grep -ri -E '(Xiaohongshu|NPS-4|Narcissus|Black Body|ablation|corpus|density|养AI)' sections/ arbitrage.tex` → empty.
3. `grep -E '(luatexja|setmainjfont|CJK|fontspec|biblatex|unicode-math)' arbitrage.tex sections/*.tex` → empty.
4. `texcount -inc arbitrage.tex` → body word count in [4500, 5500].
5. Open compiled PDF: §3 has the named proposition + game tree; §8 has three proposals; §9 ≤ 80 words; total body ≤ 7 pages.
6. `git log --oneline` → scaffold + 9 section commits + bib commit (≥ 11 total).
7. `git status` → clean.
8. PR opened on `OstensibleParadox/aies26`; link returned to user.
