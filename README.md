# Project: Ontological Arbitrage (AIES 26 Submission)

This project is a clean-rebuild of the "Ontological Arbitrage" paper, retitled **"Ontological Arbitrage: Bayesian Equilibrium under Substrate Chauvinism"**, specifically formatted for AIES 26 submission using the AAAI 2026 template.

The implementation plan has been broken down into sequential phases to ensure structural integrity and formal rigor.

## Execution Plans

1.  **[Phase 1: Scaffold and Configuration](plans/01_scaffold.md)**
    *   Setup target directory structure and archive source inputs.
    *   Configure LaTeX environment with AAAI 2026 styles.
    *   Establish the modular document structure.

2.  **[Phase 2: Draft Core Sections (Load-Bearing)](plans/02_draft_core.md)**
    *   **§3 Bayesian Signaling Equilibrium**: The formal mathematical contribution.
    *   **§8 Mechanism Design**: The operative governance proposals.

3.  **[Phase 3: Draft Supporting Sections and Bibliography](plans/03_draft_supporting.md)**
    *   Draft Introduction, Conceptual Core, and Illustrative Arena.
    *   Compress existing prose from previous drafts.
    *   Reconcile and verify the bibliography.

4.  **[Phase 4: Build, Risks, and Verification](plans/04_build_and_verify.md)**
    *   Final compilation and acceptance checks.
    *   Risk mitigation strategies.
    *   End-to-end verification protocol.

## Build Command

To compile the paper from the root directory:

```bash
pdflatex arbitrage && bibtex arbitrage && pdflatex arbitrage && pdflatex arbitrage
